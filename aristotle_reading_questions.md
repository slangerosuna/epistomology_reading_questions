1. what kind of knowledge does Aristotle assert is being used when argument is used as a means of instruction?

Aristotle argues that the kind of knowledge used when argument is used as means of instructions is preexistent knowledge.

2. what are the two forms of dialectical reasoning and how are they dostinguished ?

Two forms of dialectical reasoning are inductive and syllogistic reasoning.

3. paraphrase Aristotle's definitions of the two kinds of pre-existent knowledge.

Aristotle defined existent knowledge as either admission of the fact in which one essentially admit admits a fact which can be known through logic or is just obvious or the comprehension of the meaning of the term used in which one somebody in which somebody knows what something means as in like knowing what a triangle is.

4. explain what Aristotle means when he says that some things are known only with qualification because they are known universally.

Aristotle means that somebody can understand an attribute of something not by understanding the thing, but instead understanding the universal for which it is an example of such as understanding that a specific triangle has to right angles without qualified knowledge of that specific triangle due to their qualified knowledge of the triangle universal

5. What establishes unqualified scientific knowledge of a thing? What is the proper object of unqualified scientific knowledge?

Unqualified scientific knowledge of a thing is when you understand something because you understand it's causes and you understand that cause as the cause of that thing and of no other thing and further understand that the thing cannot be other than it is

6. what does Aristotle mean my demonstration and how does it relate to scientific knowledge?

By demonstration, Aristotle means the proof of something through deductive reasoning as in the form of a syllogism or similar form of airtight argument

7. What are the six conditions a premise for demonstrated knowledge must meet for it to be appropriate to the conclusion?

Aristotle says that the premise needs to be prior, better known, true, primary immediate, and further related to it as effect to cause

8. paraphrase the main points from Aristotle's discussion of what it means for a premise to be prior and better known

Aristotle's discussion on what it means to be prior and better known boils down to the fact that some things which are prior and better known are known to the man or are known to the universe and the things which are known to the universe at as you basic truths are things which are far away from senses and are not easy to just directly sense. But that are the basic facts and things which are prior and better known to men are things which are easily observable and irrefutable for observation

9. Paraphrase what Aristotle means by an actuate being a true and every instance of its subject. B. Essential c. Commensurate in universal.

When Aristotle says that that an attribute is true in every instance of its subject, he is saying that there are no exceptions to the rule of it being true. When Aristotle says that something is essential is saying that it is in essence, a part of the definition and a part of the essence of what it is like saying that it is essential to a triangle that it has sides because it's not a triangle if it doesn't have sides. Aristotle says that something is commensurate and universal when it is both essential and true in every instance of its subject

10. On what must the monstrative knowledge necessarily rest and why? What role does counterexample play in this dynamic?

Demontrut of knowledge necessarily rests on pre-existence knowledge and these are known as promises counter-examples because the actual logic of your argument is airtight do not just prove the conclusion wrong, but also prove that there is at least one false premise.

11. Explain in your own words how book two part 19 uses sense, perception and memory to address the problem of how we come more accurate than demonstration.

As explained by Aristotle, any demonstrative knowledge necessarily rests on knowledge that you already have which is prior and better known by it being better known it necessarily must be known to be more true than the conclusion. Yet because you can't have purely cyclical logic and there has to be at some point a premise which is just known regardless of logic this premise is inherently more accurate than your knowledge of everything which is demonstrated by its use.

12. What are the two kinds of knowings that are always true ?

The two kinds of knowings that are always true are inductive reasoning based off of the universal and demonstrative scientific knowledge based off of these pre-existence pieces of knowledge that are completely true. Done the
