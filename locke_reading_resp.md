# 1: about what is knowledge exclusively conversant?

our knowledge is conversant about our ideas only
> "Since the mind, in all its thoughts and reasonings, hath no other immediate object but its own ideas, which it along does or can contemplate, it is evident that our knowledge is only conversant about them."

# 2: according to Locke, of what does knowledge consist?

locke states that it consists of "the perception of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas."

# 3: What are the four sorts of agreement or disagreement of ideas? Identify and provdie a brief explanation of each.

Idetity or Diversity: This is the first type of agreement or disagreement that Locke discusses. Identity refers to the perception that an idea is the same as itself, and diversity signifies that one idea is different from another. This is the most fundamental form of agreement or disagreement, and it is the foundation for all other types of knowledge.

Abstract Relations Between Ideas: Locke describes the second type as relative. This form involves perceiving the relations between two ideas, regardless of whether they are related to substances, modes, or any other concept. It is the understanding of how ideas relate to each other, such as cause and effect or resemblance.

Necessary Co-existence in Substances: The third type of agreement or disagreement relates to co-existence or non-co-existence in the same subject, primarily concerning substances. For example, if we say that gold is "fixed," we mean that the idea of fixedness coexists with the idea of yellowness, weight, fusibility, and other properties that make up our concept of gold.

Real Existence: The fourth and final type involves the agreement of actual, real existence with an idea. When we say, "God is," we are making a statement about the real existence of God. This type of agreement concerns the existence of external objects in the world.n

# 4: What are the two types of knowledge Locke idnetifies, and wjat are their characteristics? (N.B.: One of the two types has two different degrees; discuss both degrees.)

Actal Knowledge: Actual knowledge is the first type of knowledge described by Locke. It involves the present awareness or perception that the mind has of the agreement or disagreement of its ideas. In other words, it's the immediate, direct perception of the connection between ideas. When a person has actual knowledge of something, they are currently aware of the relationship between their ideas, and they perceive the truth or falsity of a proposition.

Habitual Knowledge: Habitual knowledge is the second type of knowledge discussed by Locke. It has two different degrees:

a. The first degree of habitual knowledge is the knowledge of truths that are stored in memory and can be recalled upon reflection. These are truths that, when presented to the mind, are evident, and the mind perceives the agreement or disagreement of the ideas involved. The person has learned and retained these truths through prior clear and distinct perceptions.

b. The second degree of habitual knowledge is the knowledge of truths that a person remembers as being certain, even if the proofs or demonstrations are no longer present in their mind. In this case, the person has been convinced of the truth of a proposition in the past and retains the memory of that conviction. They are certain of the truth of the proposition, even if they cannot recall the specific proof or demonstration that initially convinced them.u

# 5: In descending order of certainty, identify the three degrees of knowledge and their main qualities.

Intitive Knowledge: Intuitive knowledge is the highest degree of certainty. It is characterized by immediate and self-evident perception. When you have intuitive knowledge, you don't need any further proof or demonstration because the truth is evident in the ideas themselves. For example, the knowledge that "a whole is greater than any of its parts" is intuitive because it is self-evident, and you can perceive the truth without the need for demonstration.

Demonstrative Knowledge: Demonstrative knowledge is the second degree of certainty. It relies on reasoning and demonstration. In demonstrative knowledge, you can establish the truth of a proposition by a series of logical steps, connecting ideas, and providing clear and distinct evidence. While not as self-evident as intuitive knowledge, demonstrative knowledge is still highly certain and reliable. An example would be a mathematical theorem, such as the Pythagorean theorem, which can be logically demonstrated.

Sensitive Knowledge: Sensitive knowledge is the lowest degree of certainty. It is based on the information acquired through our senses and is often considered less certain than intuitive and demonstrative knowledge. Sensitive knowledge is subject to the limitations and fallibility of our sensory experiences. It includes knowledge of the external world and empirical observations. For instance, knowing that it is currently raining outside is a form of sensitive knowledge, but it is less certain than the other two degrees because sensory experiences can sometimes be deceptive or misleading.u

# 6: Summarize Locke's conclusions about the extent of our knowledge (Chapter III)
 
the extent of human knowledge is significantly limited. He asserts that knowledge is rooted in the perception of the agreement or disagreement of our ideas, and it can only extend as far as the ideas we possess. Locke identifies three main forms of knowledge: intuitive (the most certain), demonstrative (based on reasoning), and sensitive (limited to sensory experience). However, he emphasizes that even these forms of knowledge have inherent limitations, and they do not encompass the entirety of human understanding. Locke also underscores the vastness of human ignorance, recognizing that our knowledge is much narrower than the realm of things and ideas we do not yet understand.

# 7: How does Locke answer the objection this his definition of knowledge brings us no closer to reality since any and all ideas canbe examined for their agreement or disagreement?

Locke's response to this objection is that true knowledge, or "real truth," is not just about manipulating ideas or words but involves ensuring that our ideas accurately correspond to external reality, making it distinct from mere verbal truths based on imaginative or arbitrary propositions.
 
# 8: What does Locke contend is a proper understanding of the concept of truth? Explain his main points.

Locke argues that a proper understanding of truth involves comparing our ideas and words to see if they accurately represent the real agreements or disagreements among things in the external world. In essence, truth is about ensuring that our mental and verbal propositions align with the actual state of affairs in nature.
