# 1: Why do you think Socrates and Theaetetus shifted their discussion from “What is knowledge” to what we mean by “to know”? I.e., why do they hope this might lead them to discover the truth?

Socrates states that 'to know' is commonly defined as 'to have knowledge" for which he disagrees, stating that instead it is 'to posses knowledge.' Given this, he is able to analyze what it is that those whith knowledge posses as a means of defining knowledge in it of itself, because as agreed upon earlier with Theaetetus, knowledge is in the interaction between the subject mind and the object of which knowledege is attained, given this, Socrates re-focuses on the interaction itself, or, what it is for the subject 'to know' about the object.

# 2: Explain Socrates’ distinction between “having” and “possessing.”

Socrates describes 'to possess' as the ability to acquire and have at will, such as a hat in a dresser, while he defines 'to have' as to actively make use of, such as a hat that is on a head.

# 3: Paraphrase the main points to be drawn from Socrates’ metaphor of the aviary.

Socrates usees a metaphor of an aviary to define his percecption of the possession of knowledge as akin to keeping a bird, which is representetive of a pirece of knowledge in an aviary, which is representative of our memory of pieces of knowledge. He believes that one does not engage in the active 'having' of knowledge, like holding all of the birds of knowledge in our hand, but instead believes that we all keep a storage of the pieces of knowledge that we know where we can attain them at will, potentially with the need to search our mind in the same way that one might search an aviary for a specific bird.

# 4: What aspect of knowledge is Socrates implying by distinguishing between true opinion and false opinion?

Socrates initially defines the difference between true and false opinion of when you attain the correct piece of knowledge from the mind, and when you attain the incorrect piece of knowledge from the mind, respectively. But then later clarifies that, in the smae vain that one can possess the correct, true piece of nowledge, one can, as well possess a form of ignorance, or a false opinion.

# 5: What does Socrates demonstrate in his discussion of judges?

Socrates makes it clear, that a judge cannot know directly of an act commmited by others, but can, through persuasion from bothsides, come to a true opinion of the matter without the direct attainment of the knowledge, representing how true opinions and knowledge are not one in the ame, because one can attain a true opinion without complete certainty of its validity, which is a necessary step twoards true knowledge. This gives a distinction from the true, knowable, and known, the true and unknowable, and the true, knowable, and believed, for which knowledge only truly makes up the first of these classes. 

# 6: What important difference is there between things that can be named and things that can be defined?

It cannot be known what something is as long as that thing cannot be defined, yet something made up of undefinable names, can still be defined as the combination of the names, and therefore can be known.

# 7: What problem for the definition of knowledge as “true opinion, combined with definition or rational explanation” does the distinction between things that can be named vs. things that can be defined” present? What argument does Socrates use to demonstrate this?

Socrates raises the issue of the fact that, given that definition of knowledge, one must define something, and thus know something, as a combination of hte unknowable, meaning that they would thusly have to know the parts, and therefore the named and undefinable may still be able to be known.

# 8: Restate in your own words Socrates’ point about the relationship of parts and wholes (i.e., letters and syllables or parts and compounds).

Socretes argues that the whole is the same as the totality of its parts, meaning that the knowledge of a syllable is therefore the knowledge of the letters and sounds which define it.

# 9: What are the three possible meanings of “explanation” offered by Socrates? Restate how Socrates shows each of the three to fail at establishing a right opinion to be knowledge.

Scorates defines the three forms of explanation to be the expression of the mind in speech, the enumeration of elements, and telling the mark or sign of difference forom what is being described. He demonstrates how each can be dettached from knowledge, by showing how one can get something as the right enumeration of elements without knowing, like someone essentially guessing the correct spelling of Theaetetus' name. Additionally, he disproves the first definition by demonstrating that not all explanations are interpreted exactly as they are intended to be stated, and that the words in it of themselves may be unmeaning. Finally, he disproves the final form of explanation as able to complete knowledge by showing how you only hold the ability to distinguish the thing from others, rather than the knowledge of the ting itself
